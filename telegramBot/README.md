### Step-by-step Guide:

1. **Set Up the Bot with Pyrogram**:
   First, ensure you have Pyrogram installed and a bot token from the Telegram BotFather.

   ```bash
   pip install pyrogram
   ```

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Key Steps:
1. **Bot Initialization**:
   - You need your Telegram bot's `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, and `BOT_TOKEN`. You can get the bot token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
   - You should create Cred.py. Like this,
        ```python
        class Cred:
            # For authentications
            API_ID =   # Telegram API ID
            API_HASH =   # Telegram API Hash
            BOT_TOKEN =  # Telegram Bot Token
        ```
   - Initialize the Pyrogram `Client` with this information.

2. **Command Handling**:
   - `start`: A simple command that welcomes the user.
   - `check`: This command handles the main functionality of checking for available appointments.
   
3. **Integrate Existing Code**:
   - Your form submission and scraping logic is integrated into the `/check` command.
   - The `CloudflareBypasser` and ChromiumPage logic is used to retrieve and maintain headers for the requests.
   - Once you get the response from the form submission, you either return the available dates or an error message.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use `try-except` to catch any errors during form submission or scraping and send the error message back to the user.

### Testing the Bot:
- After running the bot, you can initiate a conversation with the bot and issue the `/check` command to check for available appointment dates.
