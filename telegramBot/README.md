### Step-by-step Guide:

1. **Set Up the Bot with Pyrogram**:
   - First, ensure you have Pyrogram installed and a bot token from the Telegram BotFather.

   ```bash
   pip install pyrogram
   ```

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   - You should create Cred.py. Like this,
        ```python
        class Cred:
            # For authentications
            API_ID =   # Telegram API ID
            API_HASH =   # Telegram API Hash
            BOT_TOKEN =  # Telegram Bot Token
        ```

To check for appointments every 60 seconds, you can run the `check_appointments` function periodically using Python's `asyncio` and scheduling methods. Since you're working within Pyrogram, which is asynchronous, it’s important to set up a background task that triggers the check every 60 seconds.

Here’s how you can modify your bot to include periodic checks:

### Steps to Implement Periodic Checks:

1. **Use `asyncio` to Run a Task Periodically**:
   Pyrogram works with `asyncio`, so you can schedule a task to run every 60 seconds.

2. **Create a Background Task**:
   You can run a background task within Pyrogram using `asyncio.create_task`.

3. **Notify the User Periodically**:
   When new updates or appointment slots are available, you can send the information to the user.

To improve the efficiency of the bot and avoid loading the driver again and again unless necessary, you can implement a logic where the driver is only loaded if the `response.status_code` is not 200. You can save the `headers` after the initial successful retrieval and reuse them in future requests.

### Steps:
1. Load the `driver` and bypass Cloudflare only the first time.
2. If `response.status_code` is not 200, reload the `driver` and update the `headers`.
3. If `response.status_code` is 200, reuse the existing `headers` in future requests.

### Key Changes:
1. **Global `global_headers`:**
   - The headers retrieved from `cf_bypasser.get_headers()` are stored in a global variable `global_headers`.
   - This way, the driver and Cloudflare bypass only happen once, unless an issue occurs.

2. **`load_driver_and_bypass` Function:**
   - A helper function that encapsulates the logic of loading the Chromium driver, bypassing Cloudflare, and extracting headers. This function is called when the headers are not available or if a response fails.

3. **Conditional Driver Reloading:**
   - If the initial `response.status_code` is not 200, the driver is reloaded to bypass Cloudflare again and refresh the headers.

4. **Global `user_chat_id`:**
   - A global variable `user_chat_id` is used to store the ID of the user to whom appointment updates will be sent periodically.

5. **`check_appointments_periodically` Function:**
   - This function runs an infinite loop (`while True`) and checks for appointments every 60 seconds using `asyncio.sleep(60)` to pause the loop.
   - The function sends messages to the user with the result of each check.

6. **`/start` Command:**
   - When the user sends the `/start` command, their chat ID is saved, and the periodic checking starts with `asyncio.create_task`.
   
7. **`/stop` Command:**
   - This command allows the user to stop the periodic checking by setting `user_chat_id` to `None`.

### Summary of the Flow:
- When the user sends `/start`, the bot will begin checking for appointments every 60 seconds and sending updates to the user.
- If the user wants to stop receiving periodic updates, they can send the `/stop` command.

### How It Works:
1. **First Request**: The driver is loaded, and the headers are retrieved using `cf_bypasser`. These headers are stored in the `global_headers` variable.
2. **Subsequent Requests**: The bot reuses the headers for future requests. Only if a non-200 status is encountered will the driver be reloaded, and the headers refreshed.
3. **Periodic Check**: The `check_appointments_periodically` function continues to check for appointments every 60 seconds without reloading the driver unless necessary.

This approach optimizes performance by minimizing the number of times the driver is loaded and bypassed for Cloudflare, while ensuring that failures due to Cloudflare protection can be handled gracefully by reloading when needed.
